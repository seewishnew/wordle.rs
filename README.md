# Wordle

This project is the frontend half of the wordle game written almost entirely in Rust using the Yew framework. The [wordle backend](https://github.com/seewishnew/wordle-backend.rs) project is required to be deployed for the fronend to work.

The frontend app consists a user registration page, a menu to create or join an existing game, a game creation page where the solution can be entered for a new game, a leaderboard page for the game creator to watch other players' scores, and the actual wordle page for the players to solve the puzzle.
